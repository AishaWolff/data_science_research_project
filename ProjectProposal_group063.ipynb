    "Healthcare spending is a heavily debated topic in politics, but can we learn from the outcomes of countries' different healthcare policies around the world? We aim to research the correlation between healthcare expenditure per capita and quality of received care among developed countries with public healthcare systems. Here, we define quality of care as a collection of the proportion of preventable deaths, surgery wait times, life expectancies, and healthcare satisfaction rates. The amount of financial resources allocated to healthcare in various individual countries have been found to impact the overall quality of the healthcare provided. How healthcare outcomes correlate with the amount of healthcare expenditure has gotten mixed results, although many results find a positive correlation, especially in OECD countries<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous works differ in the exact results because of different metrics used. However, even though there may be a mild positive correlation between healthcare expenditure and  overall satisfaction in most, a lot of results also indicate that there is no clear positive or negative correlation between healthcare expenditure and quality of care received<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) -- especially when the spending is not efficiently utilized,<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). The study published by The Annals of Internal Medicine is a synthesis of several prior studies to determine if there is an association between healthcare cost and quality in the United States<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). It observes studies over the years of 1990-2012, concluding that the association was relatively clinically insignificant. This is one of the reasons why we decided to focus solely on countries with public healthcare systems, as government spending has a larger direct impact on the healthcare system as a whole.\n",

    "Increased healthcare expenditure per capita is positively correlated with lower preventable deaths, shorter surgery wait times, and higher life expectancies across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In our background analysis, we found that several previously conducted studies indicated that greater healthcare expenditure correlates to increased healthcare quality. As such, we expect similarly positive results since our definition of healthcare quality includes variables similar to those analyzed across previous studies. We believe this is further increased by the fact that we have carefully narrowed our scope to OECD countries with public healthcare.\n"

    "- Average surgery wait time \n",

    "Observations (rows):\n",
    "\n",
    "Country and year as index: Data from at least 10-20 countries to provide enough variability in healthcare expenditure and outcomes and a time range of 10 years for each country would be ideal\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be gathered from credible and consistent sources WHO, OECD, and Worldbank. We can extract these data directly since they are publicly available. If not, all data (specifically type of currency) should be standardized (e.g. converted to USD) to be able to compare spendings across different countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "For data wrangling, we will use Python’s Pandas for easy editing and analysis of our data, then store datasets in csv files. The datasets should be in tidy formats, meaning the observations will be in rows (country, year) and the variables will be in columns (e.g. preventative death rate, average surgery wait time etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "A hierarchical index of country and year would help us with time series analysis, while allowing for cross-sectional comparisons within each year of a country. This way, not only we would be able to compare spendings across countries, but also within each country over a span of a couple years.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single dataset that will give us all of the information that we are looking for. However, by analyzing the data by country, we are able to merge several datasets by country to get all of the information that we want into one large dataframe. This way, we can find readily available datasets that we can then combine to collect all the variables that we want to analyze.\n",

    "- In terms of data collection, we do not have to deal with informed consent or anything related to the creation of a study, because we are using previously-compiled datasets. \n",
    "- As for data storage, we don’t need to secure the data that we have gathered here, because they are all from readily available online datasets. There will be no “individuals” in our dataset because we are collecting data by country rather than by individual patients, so no anonymizing or ‘right to be forgotten’ needs to be addressed.\n",
    "- There are additional potential confounding variables to our analysis such as education of the healthcare providers, lifestyles by country, and access to resources not directly relating to healthcare itself, as such, this study is purely intended to explore correlation between the established variables, not establish causality.\n",
    "- The data may not adequately represent marginalized populations or those without access to healthcare, leading to skewed results\n",
    "Some countries may report healthcare outcomes differently, leading to potential bias - countries with less rigorous data collection systems may underreport certain issues\n",
    "- We will avoid looking at data within LCD countries, specifically focusing on OECD countries. This is because high-income countries often provide more detailed healthcare data than low-income or developing countries. This lack of data from lower-income nations could skew analyses toward healthcare systems that are well-funded, leading to overgeneralized findings that don’t apply to all income levels. Also, for LDC countries, there might be other strong reasons for why healthcare might be low quality other than healthcare spending (e.g. war).\n",
    "- Country-level data might also cover some disparities among different minority groups in each country. For example, in the US, healthcare quality significantly varies across different states and cities, so the overall data of the country might misrepresent the level of healthcare quality received by its citizens. For this problem, if OECD provides regional data for bigger countries, we should incorporate these regional variations.\n",
