    "\n",
    "This project explores whether increased healthcare expenditure per capita is positively correlated with lower preventable deaths, shorter hospital stays, greater access to medical technology, and higher life expectancies at birth across OECD countries from 2000 to 2019. Our hypothesis was that greater healthcare spending is positively correlated with lower preventable deaths, shorter hospital stay lengths, greater medical technology access, and higher life expectancies at birth across countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, we compiled and standardized multiple datasets from the OECD, ensuring consistency across countries and years by tidying data through a custom preprocessing function. Key steps included cleaning column names, filtering for relevant variables, converting data to numeric formats, and restricting the analysis to the years 2000–2019 to avoid confounding effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. To analyze the relationship between healthcare expenditure and healthcare quality, we developed a ranking system for each considered variable—preventable deaths, hospital stay lengths, medical technology access, and life expectancy—assigning lower ranks to better performance (e.g., a rank of 1 for the best). The function calculated the mean and standard deviation for each variable to determine appropriate weights for a weighted average. We then aggregated these rankings into a composite score for each country, reflecting overall healthcare quality. After cleaning and finalizing the rankings, we examined the correlation between a country's healthcare quality ranking and its healthcare expenditure rankings, both as a percentage of GDP and per capita.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite prior research indicating a positive correlation between expenditure and healthcare quality, our findings did not support the hypothesis. Statistical analysis revealed no significant relationship between healthcare expenditure, whether measured as a percentage of GDP or per capita, and the metrics of healthcare quality defined in this study. This includes preventable deaths, average hospital stay lengths, access to medical technology, and life expectancies. The results contrast with previous studies and suggest that while financial resources are necessary for a functioning healthcare system, their impact on quality outcomes rely more on efficient allocation/management rather than the amount spent."

    "Healthcare spending is a heavily debated topic in politics, but can we learn from the outcomes of countries' different healthcare policies around the world? We aim to research the correlation between healthcare expenditure per capita and quality of received care among developed countries with public healthcare systems. Here, we define quality of care as a collection of the proportion of preventable deaths, surgery wait times, life expectancies, and healthcare satisfaction rates. The amount of financial resources allocated to healthcare in various individual countries have been found to impact the overall quality of the healthcare provided. How healthcare outcomes correlate with the amount of healthcare expenditure has gotten mixed results, although many results find a positive correlation, especially in OECD countries. OECD countries are a collection of countries with market-based economies that work together to create policies for sustainable growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The previous works differ in the exact results because of different metrics used. However, even though there may be a mild positive correlation between healthcare expenditure and overall satisfaction in most, a lot of results also indicate that there is no clear positive or negative correlation between healthcare expenditure and quality of care received2 -- especially when the spending is not efficiently utilized,3. The study published by The Annals of Internal Medicine is a synthesis of several prior studies to determine if there is an association between healthcare cost and quality in the United States2. It observes studies over the years of 1990-2012, concluding that the association was relatively clinically insignificant. This is one of the reasons why we decided to focus solely on countries with public healthcare systems, as government spending has a larger direct impact on the healthcare system as a whole.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our background analysis, we found that several previously conducted studies indicated that greater healthcare expenditure correlates to increased healthcare quality. As such, we expect similarly positive results since our definition of healthcare quality includes variables similar to those analyzed across previous studies. We believe this is further increased by the fact that we have carefully narrowed our scope to OECD countries with public healthcare."

Every dataset is set up to have a year and country code column, where each country is represented from the years 2000-2019, so this won't be an issue. After this, we will drop down to only the OECD countries and fix any naming inconsistencies, then examine if there are any gaps in columns certain rows (which represent a country, year combination), and decide what to do in those cases, potentially dropping the row. We have not yet dropped NA values in data rows, as we will decide what to do about it once everything is merged into one dataset."

    "Since several of our datasets were from the same OECD information website, the datasets often had the same general layout when downloaded. Therefore, we created a function `tidy` that takes in some input parameters specific to a given dataset and runs a common set of steps on that dataframe in order to tidy it. This way, we weren't copy pasting the code and modifying it a bunch. Our goals in tidying were to make all column names lowercase and reduce the columns in every dataset to just have country, country code, year, and the variable that is being analyzed. This way, they could all be merged into one large dataframe later on. Furthermore, we wanted the year and variable columns to be numeric so they could be easily analyzed. Then, we wanted to make sure the years were in the range [2000, 2019] for all datasets, as we wanted a relatively large number of years that were likely to have data. We avoided 2020 and onward data because COVID-19 brought far more confounding variables and changes in healthcare policies that we felt would make the analysis far less valuable and more confusing. In tidying, we also wanted to sort dataframes by country and year to make them easier to read and analyze."

Positive correlations exist between expenditure per capita and life expectancy, suggesting that increased investment in healthcare can lead to better health (life expectancy) outcomes. Additionally, countries with greater availability of medical technology tend to allocate more resources to healthcare. On the other hand, longer hospital stays appear to be associated with lower healthcare expenditures. This is what we would expect, as more healthcare resources would allow for lower wait times. One interesting value to note is the correlation between expenditure per capita and avoidable deaths appears to be 0. This is surprising, as it would suggest that a change in healthcare per person does not seem to change the number of avoidable deaths. In other words, increasing spending does not necessarily lead to more lives saved."

Like in the heat map, we can see that positive correlations are observed between expenditure per capita and life expectancy, suggesting that increased healthcare spending can lead to improved health outcomes. Additionally, there is a negative correlation between avoidable deaths and healthcare expenditure, indicating that countries with higher spending may have fewer preventable deaths. The scatter plot allows us to see that many variables do not increase in a linear pattern with expenditure per capita, so we may want to try out some nonlinear models in the future when trying to discern patterns between healthcare expenditure and other quality of care variables."

    "Here, we can see that the gdp and population of these 3 countries are in fact growing at different rates. For each of the three countries, the gdp is increasing while the population is barely increasing or, in the case of Hungary, the population is actually decreasing. Using these visualizations, we can understand why there is a negative correlation between healthcare as a percentage of gdp and healthcare per capita for these 3 countries: their gdp is increasing substantially faster than their populations, meaning the same healthcare expenditure values when viewed from these 2 different perspectives show different values. However, since this is only the case with these 3 countries, we will use healthcare per capita (without worrying about gdp) to understand the relationship between healthcare spending and our various dependent quality of care variables. This also makes sense for most of the metrics, since it is often more useful in the case of medical success to look at spending in relation to population as opposed to gdp. The reason for this is that population directly impacts how stretched thin a country's healthcare system is, while gdp does not necessarily directly affect the healthcare system. Ultimately, we are safe to just use healthcare per capita while analyzing other variables."

There is too much variation among countries, with some countries having high expenditure but relatively low technology availability, and vice versa.

Each bar represents a country, and the length of the bar indicate the strength and direction of the correlation. Positive correlations suggest that countries with higher expenditure per capita tend to have larger populations, while negative correlations indicate the opposite. Overall, we can see that there is a positive correlation between expenditure per capita and population, other than the few outliers (Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, and Turkey). If we look at countries with 0 correlation, it would mean that over the years as population changes, this has little effect on the expenditure per capita. This would indicate that with the change in population, the expenditure is changing at roughly the same rate, meaning the amount of people does not affec the amount of healthcare expenditure per person. For the majority of countries, this is not the case, however as population changes, the expenditure per person changes with it. In other words, as the population grows, so too does the amount of healthcare spending per person, meaning total expenditure (not per person) is growing faster than the population, rather than at the same rate. With the outliers, the opposite is true: as the population grows, the expenditure per person is not keeping up. This could meant that the expenditure is stagnant while the population grows, among other possibilities (like expenditure per person increasing as population decreases). Overall, this chart is a good indicator of how countries are keeping up with their healthcare expenditure in relation to population changes."

Overall, most countries have a positive correlation between expenditure as a percentage of GDP and population, other than the outliers (Estonia, Ireland, Iceland, Luxembourg, and Turkey). A near zero correlation would indicate that a country's change in population does not affect its healthcare expenditure per capita. If population and gdp were to grow at similar ratios, then this would likely have a large impact on the healthcare expenditure per capita. However, if population were to grow faster than gdp, the amount spent per person would decrease over time, potentially leading to issues of an overburdened healthcare system. Countries with positive correlations would indicate that those countries are in tune with the growth of population and change their healthcare spending in correlation with the change in population; as a population grows, so too does the amount spent as a percentage of gdp. Alternatively, it could also mean that shrinking populations would require less expenditure. A negative correlation could be an indication that a country is valuing healthcare expenditure as the population decreases or slows. For example, fewer kids are being born, so the average age of the population increases, leading to more necessary healthcare expenditure for the country. Of course, it is impossible to make such a statement from just this one graph. That said, they are interesting datapoints to keep an eye on. "

    "* In terms of data collection, we do not have to deal with informed consent or anything related to the creation of a study, because we are using previously-compiled datasets.\n",
    "* As for data storage, we don’t need to secure the data that we have gathered here, because they are all from readily available online datasets. There will be no “individuals” in our dataset because we are collecting data by country rather than by individual patients, so no anonymizing or ‘right to be forgotten’ needs to be addressed.\n",
    "* There are additional potential confounding variables to our analysis such as education of the healthcare providers, lifestyles by country, and access to resources not directly relating to healthcare itself, as such, this study is purely intended to explore correlation between the established variables, not establish causality.\n",
    "* The data may not adequately represent marginalized populations or those without access to healthcare, leading to skewed results Some countries may report healthcare outcomes differently, leading to potential bias - countries with less rigorous data collection systems may underreport certain issues.\n",
    "* We will avoid looking at data within LCD countries, specifically focusing on OECD countries. This is because high-income countries often provide more detailed healthcare data than low-income or developing countries. This lack of data from lower-income nations could skew analyses toward healthcare systems that are well-funded, leading to overgeneralized findings that don’t apply to all income levels. Also, for LDC countries, there might be other strong reasons for why healthcare might be low quality other than healthcare spending (e.g. war).\n",
    "* Country-level data might also cover some disparities among different minority groups in each country. For example, in the US, healthcare quality significantly varies across different states and cities, so the overall data of the country might misrepresent the level of healthcare quality received by its citizens. For this problem, if OECD provides regional data for bigger countries, we should incorporate these regional variations.\n",

    "# Discusison and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aimed to explore the relationship between healthcare quality and expenditure among OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, given their more stable economies compared to less developed nations, from 2000 to 2019. We took a multi-faceted approach to assess healthcare systems, utilizing metrics such as hospital stay lengths, medical technology availability, life expectancy, and avoidable deaths to construct a comprehensive healthcare quality index. This method involved ranking individual variables and then combining them with weighted and unweighted averages to determine an overall rank for each country. By comparing these quality rankings with healthcare expenditure—both as a percentage of GDP and per capita—we aimed to uncover potential links between government spending on healthcare and health outcomes. However, it is important to note that “healthcare quality” is a broad term, defined differently across sources, including the ones referenced in the Background and Prior Work section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed a positive correlation between healthcare expenditure per capita and life expectancy at birth, suggesting that higher investment in healthcare systems is associated with longer lifespans. This aligns with our hypothesis and underscores the idea that increased government spending can improve population-level health outcomes. However, the correlations between healthcare expenditure and other metrics, such as preventable deaths, hospital stay lengths, and access to medical technology, were weaker or inconclusive. This indicates that while spending is a crucial factor in healthcare quality, it is not the sole determinant of outcomes in these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results suggest that higher healthcare expenditure does not necessarily correlate with better healthcare quality overall for the variables considered in this analysis. For example, the United States ranked highest in healthcare quality despite its significantly high spending, both as a percentage of GDP and per capita. Conversely, Turkey achieved a strong rank in healthcare quality with much lower expenditure. Countries like Germany and Switzerland, which allocate substantial portions of their GDP to healthcare, did not achieve top rankings in quality. This emphasizes the point that simply increasing financial resources does not guarantee better outcomes, highlighting the importance of evaluating healthcare systems from perspectives that extend beyond financial investment, focusing on how resources are allocated and the effectiveness of healthcare services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, countries such as France, which spend less per capita but allocate a higher percentage of their GDP to healthcare, ranked highly. This suggests that these nations may be prioritizing healthcare relative to their economic output rather than focusing solely on the total amount of expenditure. It indicates that the overall investment in healthcare, as a proportion of GDP, could play a more significant role in determining healthcare quality and outcomes than per capita spending alone. Furthermore, this underscores the importance of considering broader economic factors and systemic policies when evaluating healthcare systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our hypothesis was not fully supported, and further exploration is needed to understand the complex relationship between healthcare expenditure and healthcare quality. This aligns with the Background Work that we have looked in as well, as some research was able to find strong correlations, while others were not. While financial investment remains a critical component—particularly evident in life expectancy—its impact is shaped by numerous structural, operational, and policy factors. Policymakers must prioritize systemic improvements, ensure the efficient allocation of resources, and foster equitable access to healthcare in order to translate financial investment into meaningful health outcomes.\n",
