    "Healthcare spending is a heavily debated topic in politics, but can we learn from the outcomes of countries' different healthcare policies around the world? We aim to research the correlation between healthcare expenditure per capita and quality of received care among developed countries with public healthcare systems. Here, we define quality of care as a collection of the proportion of preventable deaths, surgery wait times, life expectancies, and healthcare satisfaction rates. The amount of financial resources allocated to healthcare in various individual countries have been found to impact the overall quality of the healthcare provided. How healthcare outcomes correlate with the amount of healthcare expenditure has gotten mixed results, although many results find a positive correlation, especially in OECD countries1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous works differ in the exact results because of different metrics used. However, even though there may be a mild positive correlation between healthcare expenditure and overall satisfaction in most, a lot of results also indicate that there is no clear positive or negative correlation between healthcare expenditure and quality of care received2 -- especially when the spending is not efficiently utilized,3. The study published by The Annals of Internal Medicine is a synthesis of several prior studies to determine if there is an association between healthcare cost and quality in the United States2. It observes studies over the years of 1990-2012, concluding that the association was relatively clinically insignificant. This is one of the reasons why we decided to focus solely on countries with public healthcare systems, as government spending has a larger direct impact on the healthcare system as a whole.\n",

    "Increased healthcare expenditure per capita is positively correlated with lower preventable deaths, shorter surgery wait times, and higher life expectancies across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our background analysis, we found that several previously conducted studies indicated that greater healthcare expenditure correlates to increased healthcare quality. As such, we expect similarly positive results since our definition of healthcare quality includes variables similar to those analyzed across previous studies. We believe this is further increased by the fact that we have carefully narrowed our scope to OECD countries with public healthcare.\n"

We only limited the dataset to include only data from 2000 to 2019 like we did in all the other datasets and specifically for the World Bank data we needed to use the \"melt\" function from pandas so the years would appear as observations instead of variables.\n",

There will be no “individuals” in our dataset because we are collecting data by country rather than by individual patients, so no anonymizing or ‘right to be forgotten’ needs to be addressed.\n",

This is because high-income countries often provide more detailed healthcare data than low-income or developing countries. This lack of data from lower-income nations could skew analyses toward healthcare systems that are well-funded, leading to overgeneralized findings that don’t apply to all income levels. Also, for LDC countries, there might be other strong reasons for why healthcare might be low quality other than healthcare spending (e.g. war).\n",
    "* Country-level data might also cover some disparities among different minority groups in each country. For example, in the US, healthcare quality significantly varies across different states and cities, so the overall data of the country might misrepresent the level of healthcare quality received by its citizens. For this problem, if OECD provides regional data for bigger countries, we should incorporate these regional variations.\n",
    "* Over-simplifications of the effects of spending and healthcare, if interpreted for policy-making could lead to a focus on only financially efficient initiatives and not initiatives that are currently critical in their country. This is not intended to inform political or financial decisions."
