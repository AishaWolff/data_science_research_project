    "Healthcare spending is a heavily debated topic in politics, but can we learn from the outcomes of countries' different healthcare policies around the world? We aim to research the correlation between healthcare expenditure per capita and quality of received care among developed countries with public healthcare systems. Here, we define quality of care as a collection of the proportion of preventable deaths, surgery wait times, life expectancies, and healthcare satisfaction rates. The amount of financial resources allocated to healthcare in various individual countries have been found to impact the overall quality of the healthcare provided. How healthcare outcomes correlate with the amount of healthcare expenditure has gotten mixed results, although many results find a positive correlation, especially in OECD countries1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous works differ in the exact results because of different metrics used. However, even though there may be a mild positive correlation between healthcare expenditure and overall satisfaction in most, a lot of results also indicate that there is no clear positive or negative correlation between healthcare expenditure and quality of care received2 -- especially when the spending is not efficiently utilized,3. The study published by The Annals of Internal Medicine is a synthesis of several prior studies to determine if there is an association between healthcare cost and quality in the United States2. It observes studies over the years of 1990-2012, concluding that the association was relatively clinically insignificant. This is one of the reasons why we decided to focus solely on countries with public healthcare systems, as government spending has a larger direct impact on the healthcare system as a whole.\n",

    "Increased healthcare expenditure per capita is positively correlated with lower preventable deaths, shorter surgery wait times, and higher life expectancies across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our background analysis, we found that several previously conducted studies indicated that greater healthcare expenditure correlates to increased healthcare quality. As such, we expect similarly positive results since our definition of healthcare quality includes variables similar to those analyzed across previous studies. We believe this is further increased by the fact that we have carefully narrowed our scope to OECD countries with public healthcare.\n"

We only limited the dataset to include only data from 2000 to 2019 like we did in all the other datasets and specifically for the World Bank data we needed to use the \"melt\" function from pandas so the years would appear as observations instead of variables.\n",

We used mostly the same process as we did in the first dataset to clean this data (using melt function, dropping unnecessary columns, etc.) because the two datasets are very similar. The only difference between the two was that the value for #2 was life expectancy instead of healthcare expenditure per capita.\n",

The dataset has avoidable mortality as defined by deaths that could have been avoided given proper measures and healthcare access. This dataset needed cleaning to only include the dates we are analyzing (2000-2019).\n",

    "Dataset #4 shows data from OECD Data Explorer and shows the average length of stay by diagnostic categories. The average length of stay is calculated in this dataset by dividing the number of \"bed-days\" by number of discharges in the given year. This dataset needed to be cleaned to include our dates of interest (2000-2019) and drop excess columns to see the length of stay.\n",

This is a float between between 0 and 100 (although no country has near 100). We limited the data from 2000-2019, and used the same tidy() function we wrote that was used in datasests 3 and onward (for all the OECD Data Explorer datasets). This function drops unnecessary columns, renames them to lowercase with no spaces, sorts the dataframe by country then year, and saves in two steps: one as an informational dataframe (with text-based columns), and one with only country, country code, year, and numerical columns. \n",

These technologies are the following (from OECD Data Explorer): \"computed tomography scanners, magnetic resonance imaging units, positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, gamma cameras, mammographs, and radiation therapy equipment\". The datatype of this value column is a float, and it is greater than or equal to 0. These values are a proxy for how well equipped a medical system is in relation to its population size.\n",

    "Dataset #8 is a dataset from OECD Data Explorer and shows the gross fixed capital formation in the healtchare system of each country, measured by the \"total value of the fixed assets that health providers have acquired during the accounting period\" that are used for longer than one year for healthcare services (OECD Data Explorer). The datatype of this is floats, and the values are greater than or equal to 0.

Every dataset is set up to have a year and country code column, where each country is represented from the years 2000-2019, so this won't be an issue. After this, we will drop down to only the OECD countries and fix any naming inconsistencies, then examine if there are any gaps in columns certain rows (which represent a country, year combination), and decide what to do in those cases, potentially dropping the row. We have not yet dropped NA values in data rows, as we will decide what to do about it once everything is merged into one dataset."

There will be no “individuals” in our dataset because we are collecting data by country rather than by individual patients, so no anonymizing or ‘right to be forgotten’ needs to be addressed.\n",

    "* The data may not adequately represent marginalized populations or those without access to healthcare, leading to skewed results Some countries may report healthcare outcomes differently, leading to potential bias - countries with less rigorous data collection systems may underreport certain issues.\n",
    "* We will avoid looking at data within LCD countries, specifically focusing on OECD countries. This is because high-income countries often provide more detailed healthcare data than low-income or developing countries. This lack of data from lower-income nations could skew analyses toward healthcare systems that are well-funded, leading to overgeneralized findings that don’t apply to all income levels. Also, for LDC countries, there might be other strong reasons for why healthcare might be low quality other than healthcare spending (e.g. war).\n",
    "* Country-level data might also cover some disparities among different minority groups in each country. For example, in the US, healthcare quality significantly varies across different states and cities, so the overall data of the country might misrepresent the level of healthcare quality received by its citizens. For this problem, if OECD provides regional data for bigger countries, we should incorporate these regional variations.\n",
